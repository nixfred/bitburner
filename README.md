Bitburner All-in-One Orchestrator

Your ultimate hacking + server management script for Bitburner. Sit back, relax, and let this script do the heavy lifting as you climb the corporate ladder of dystopian domination.

Features

This script is a one-stop shop for automating your Bitburner journey. Whether you‚Äôre a new hacker on the block or a seasoned digital overlord, this script has your back.

üõ†Ô∏è Hacking Automation
	‚Ä¢	Automatically selects the most profitable server to hack.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamically balances hacking, growing, and weakening for maximum efficiency.
	‚Ä¢	Adapts to changing server conditions to ensure your profits never stop rolling in.

üñ•Ô∏è Server Management
	‚Ä¢	Purchases new servers every 90 seconds if affordable.
	‚Ä¢	Detects and initializes manually purchased servers, ensuring they‚Äôre always added to your swarm.
	‚Ä¢	Automatically copies required scripts (hack.js, grow.js, and weaken.js) to all owned servers.

üìä Real-Time Status Reports
	‚Ä¢	Provides a clean, easy-to-read status update in your terminal every cycle.
	‚Ä¢	Tracks:
	‚Ä¢	Total earnings üí∞
	‚Ä¢	Hacking target üéØ
	‚Ä¢	Server ownership üñ•Ô∏è
	‚Ä¢	Next server cost üîç

üß† Smart Resource Management
	‚Ä¢	Prioritizes servers with more RAM for efficient task execution.
	‚Ä¢	Limits home server RAM usage to ensure you can multitask.

üéõÔ∏è Highly Configurable
	‚Ä¢	Adjustable thresholds for hacking, growing, and weakening.
	‚Ä¢	Configurable RAM usage, update intervals, and purchase settings.

Installation
	1.	Copy Required Scripts
Ensure you have the following scripts in your home directory:
	‚Ä¢	hack.js
	‚Ä¢	grow.js
	‚Ä¢	weaken.js
These are the backbone of your hacking operations. You can write them yourself or find them in the Bitburner community.
	2.	Save the Main Script
Save the orchestrator script as orch-master-all-in-one.js in your home directory.
	3.	Run the Script
Launch the script with:

run orch-master-all-in-one.js

	4.	Profit
Let the script work its magic while you plan your next big move.

How It Works
	1.	Hacking Targets
The script automatically selects the most profitable server to hack, taking into account its maximum money, security level, and growth rate.
	2.	Server Management
	‚Ä¢	Purchases new servers once the cost falls below 25% of your available funds.
	‚Ä¢	Detects manually purchased servers during runtime, ensuring they‚Äôre initialized and added to your hacking swarm.
	3.	Dynamic Scaling
	‚Ä¢	Dynamically adjusts thread assignments across all servers based on available RAM.
	‚Ä¢	Uses only 60% of home server RAM to leave room for your other scripts.
	4.	Real-Time Logging
	‚Ä¢	All reports and updates are displayed directly in the terminal.
	‚Ä¢	No pop-ups. No nonsense. Just clean logs that refresh every cycle.

Configuration

You can customize the script by modifying the following variables at the top of the file:

Variable	Description	Default Value
hackUpdateInterval	Time between hack cycles (in ms).	30000 (30s)
buyCheckInterval	Time between server purchase checks (in ms).	90000 (90s)
hackThreshold	Hack if the target‚Äôs money is above this percentage of its max.	0.75 (75%)
growThreshold	Grow if the target‚Äôs money is below this percentage of its max.	0.90 (90%)
weakenOffset	Weaken if the target‚Äôs security exceeds this value above its minimum.	10
homeRamUsageFraction	Maximum percentage of home server RAM to use for hacking operations.	0.6 (60%)
moneyThreshold	Buy a server if the cost is less than this percentage of your current funds.	0.25 (25%)
baseRam	Minimum RAM for purchased servers.	4096 (4 GB)

Example Logs

Known Issues
	‚Ä¢	Concurrency Errors: If you encounter these, ensure you have the latest version of the script. Netscript functions must always be awaited, and we‚Äôve carefully avoided concurrency issues in this version.
	‚Ä¢	Script Limitations: The script is designed for mid-to-late game scaling. Early game users may need to manually farm money before fully utilizing this script.

FAQ

Can I manually purchase servers while the script is running?

Yes! The script dynamically detects manually purchased servers and initializes them automatically.

Will it stop me from using my home server?

Nope! The script only uses up to 60% of your home server‚Äôs RAM, leaving you plenty of room to multitask.

Does it interfere with other scripts?

Not at all. It runs independently and focuses only on hacking operations and server management.
